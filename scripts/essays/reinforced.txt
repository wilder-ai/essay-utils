How good would life be in a post-scarcity civilization?

The concept of a post-scarcity civilization has been explored in science fiction for centuries, but what would it actually be like to live in one? To truly understand how good life could be in a post-scarcity civilization, we must first understand what a post-scarcity civilization is, and the advantages and disadvantages that living in one would bring. We must then explore the ways in which this kind of society could be achieved. This essay will explore all of these aspects to determine how good life could be in a post-scarcity civilization.

A post-scarcity civilization is one in which all basic needs are met for everyone, regardless of their economic or social status. This means that food, water, housing and healthcare would be available to everyone without having to worry about access or affordability (Post Scarcity Civilisations, n.d.). In such a society, there would be no need for money as all resources are abundant and readily available; instead people could focus on collaboration and creativity. However, what's actually stopping us from being post-scarcity is not lack of resources but the forced reliance on human labour (Lorenzo Pieri 2020). The key to unlocking post-scarcity is to eliminate the scarcity of human labour - this can be achieved by developing technologies that allow us to automate tasks (Lorenzo Pieri 2020) and providing citizens with a Universal Basic Income (Lorenzo Pieri 2020). This analysis suggests that post-scarcity is within reach well inside the current century with current technologies, assuming a sustained progress in the field of artificial intelligence (Lorenzo Pieri 2020), potentially leading to a more egalitarian world where everybody has equal access to resources and opportunities.

The advantages of living in a post-scarcity civilization are numerous. For starters, the basic needs of everyone would be met, alleviating poverty and hunger. Everyone would have access to education and healthcare, allowing them to maximize their potential and live healthier lives. People would also no longer worry about money or competition as these two factors wouldn't be needed anymore; instead they could focus on creative endeavors and collaborations with others (Post-scarcity world, 2019). This kind of society could potentially lead to more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities for all citizens, leading to greater equality in terms of social status. Already we can see this beginning to take shape in the form of the sharing economy (Tiago Forte, 2019), where ownership is not necessarily linked with scarcity but rather responsibility for an object's operation and maintenance. Finally, people would no longer have to worry about having enough resources or money as all basic needs are provided free of charge by the government or other organizations.

The potential disadvantages of living in a post-scarcity civilization are also worth considering. For one, it could lead to an erosion of individual responsibility as people become more and more dependent on the government or other organizations providing them with their basic needs (We Will Not Live in a Post-Scarcity Economy, 2017). This could lead to apathy and a lack of motivation among citizens, which would be detrimental to such a society. Additionally, without any competition or money involved in the distribution of resources, there is no incentive for people to work hard and innovate; thus stifling progress within the society (Ó Foghlú, 2019). Finally, some individuals may find it difficult to adjust to this type of lifestyle if they have been used to economic scarcity throughout their lives; they may struggle with adapting and understanding why resources are being provided without any need for money or competition (Bushkin & Hewitt, 2019). Despite these potential drawbacks however experts agree that overall the internet will continue making life better (Tutt 2019), allowing economies and people from all around the world move up the value chain.

In order to achieve a post-scarcity civilization, several steps would need to be taken. Firstly, the government or other organizations would need to implement policies that ensure equal access to resources and opportunities. This could include providing free healthcare, education and housing for everyone in society (Zambrano, 2017). Additionally, there must be measures put in place that guarantee the sustainability of these resources; such as investing in renewable energy sources or improving efficiency of production processes (Zambrano, 2017). For example, Zambrano (2017) discusses how we could power our farms without significant effort and how water is incredibly cheap. Furthermore, there should also be regulations that limit the amount of resources being used by certain individuals or groups so as not to create an unequal distribution of wealth and power within society. Dean Masley (2019) explains this paradox of abundance being created without anyone who can pay for it with automation reducing cost but threatening jobs while food production becomes increasingly efficient yet millions are still hungry. Finally, it is important for citizens to become more aware of their environment and the impact their actions have on it; this can be done through education programmes that promote environmental awareness and responsibility (Masley 2019). Desperate times call for desperate measures which means discussing post-scarcity like a pipe dream needs to stop if we want progress towards achieving this goal(Zambrano 2017).

Overall, living in a post-scarcity civilization could potentially be very good for everyone. Everyone would have access to the basic needs of life, alleviating poverty and hunger while also providing them with more opportunities to maximize their potential and pursue creative endeavors. However, such a society must be carefully planned in order to ensure that resources are being sustainably managed and distributed equitably among all citizens. With the right policies in place, living in a post-scarcity civilization could lead to a more prosperous and equal world where everybody can thrive.
